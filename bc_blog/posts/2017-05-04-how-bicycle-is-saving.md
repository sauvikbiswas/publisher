## Cost per kilometre

My bicycle is a 2012 Schwinn Sporterra Sport. It is one of the entry-level hybrid bicycles that has modern components. When I bought it, it cost me INR 24000. I spent some more cash on a pair of good tires and some decent accessories. That shot up the cost to INR 30000.

A bare estimate of the number of kilometres I have ridden this cycle would be about 20000 kms. One of my colleagues disagrees with me and says that I must have done 30000 or 35000 kilometres on it. I would prefer to be conservative and would stick to my figures.

That squarely puts the cost at about (INR 30000 / 20000) = INR 1.5 / km. That's freakishly cheap.

## How long will it take for me to recover my money?

Let's say that you are not an active bicycle user. If you are in a city like Bangalore, no matter how close you live (unless it is within 1 km of your office), the minimum amount that you'll have to spend would be about INR 40 one way. That's INR 80 every working day.

Now let's do the math. Assuming that the cycle has to replace the cost of commute, you'd need to ride it for ( INR 30000 / INR 80 / day = ) 375 days. Again, assuming you have about 200 working days per year, that's less than two years to break even.

The reality is that you would use your bicycle for other purposes, too - shopping, commute, meeting friends, joyrides, etc. This would significantly reduce your cost per kilometre and you would end up with a value that would be unbeatable by means that don't let the dinosaurs rest in peace.

## I don't ride to calculate my savings

Neither do I consciously pay attention to the fact that it's keeping me healthy. I ride it because it gives me joy. I would like to point out that I did not think about this aspect when I bought the bicycle. It was merely a means of transport.

But I don't have to tell you that. And I shouldn't. It's something that you'll have to experience yourself. And as you reap the joys of the longer seemingly aimless, meaningless rides, you'll get fitter and richer.

## I have put another INR 25000 in it

I have upgraded the groupset to an older M610 / T610 Deore from the stock Altus / Acera combo. I couldn't have been happier with the transmission, braking and shifting. I can peacefully use it for another five years before I need to replace something. Or maybe not!
