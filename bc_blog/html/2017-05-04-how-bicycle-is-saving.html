<h1>How my bicycle saves me money</h1>
<small>2017-05-04</small>
<h2>Cost per kilometre</h2>
<p>My bicycle is a 2012 Schwinn Sporterra Sport. It is one of the entry-level hybrid bicycles that has modern components. When I bought it, it cost me INR 24000. I spent some more cash on a pair of good tires and some decent accessories. That shot up the cost to INR 30000.</p>
<p>A bare estimate of the number of kilometres I have ridden this cycle would be about 20000 kms. One of my colleagues disagrees with me and says that I must have done 30000 or 35000 kilometres on it. I would prefer to be conservative and would stick to my figures.</p>
<p>That squarely puts the cost at about (INR 30000 / 20000) = INR 1.5 / km. That's freakishly cheap.</p>
<h2>How long will it take for me to recover my money?</h2>
<p>Let's say that you are not an active bicycle user. If you are in a city like Bangalore, no matter how close you live (unless it is within 1 km of your office), the minimum amount that you'll have to spend would be about INR 40 one way. That's INR 80 every working day.</p>
<p>Now let's do the math. Assuming that the cycle has to replace the cost of commute, you'd need to ride it for ( INR 30000 / INR 80 / day = ) 375 days. Again, assuming you have about 200 working days per year, that's less than two years to break even.</p>
<p>The reality is that you would use your bicycle for other purposes, too - shopping, commute, meeting friends, joyrides, etc. This would significantly reduce your cost per kilometre and you would end up with a value that would be unbeatable by means that don't let the dinosaurs rest in peace.</p>
<h2>I don't ride to calculate my savings</h2>
<p>Neither do I consciously pay attention to the fact that it's keeping me healthy. I ride it because it gives me joy. I would like to point out that I did not think about this aspect when I bought the bicycle. It was merely a means of transport.</p>
<p>But I don't have to tell you that. And I shouldn't. It's something that you'll have to experience yourself. And as you reap the joys of the longer seemingly aimless, meaningless rides, you'll get fitter and richer.</p>
<h2>I have put another INR 25000 in it</h2>
<p>I have upgraded the groupset to an older M610 / T610 Deore from the stock Altus / Acera combo. I couldn't have been happier with the transmission, braking and shifting. I can peacefully use it for another five years before I need to replace something. Or maybe not!</p>
