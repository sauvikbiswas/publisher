## Wu?

[Joshu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhaozhou_Congshen) asked Baba Cycle, 'So, where is the p in zen?'

Baba Cycle replied, 'That when you shall find, you shall find enlightenment sleeping underneath.'

## [Wu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu_(negative)) is Baba Cycle?

I am a thirty-three-year-old man, living in the suburbs of Bangalore, India. I don't think any extended introduction that goes beyond that description is necessary. Knowing my real name isn't necessary either. (Although, it's too easy to find that out.)

This website is the exposure of one of the fragments of my ego. This one, in particular, is slightly eccentric. It likes radical viewpoints. It likes tangential expositions. It thrives on ideas that challenges conventional wisdom. It feeds on rational systems, yet, it equally enjoys the non logical Zen koans.

This blog is that fragment's quest to liberate me and thus liberate you in the process.

Please note that the homophonic nature of this site's name with [this guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baba_Sehgal) is purely co-incidental and intentional.
