If my [introductory post](p-in-zen) read like a cryptic rant, then it was intentional. I, in my full senses, take responsibility of its cryptic nature.

## Acknowledge the existence of short-circuit thinking

We, human beings, are designed to short-circuit a thinking process that is of sufficient complexity. This is purely an evolutionary trait. Without the existence of such short-circuits, it would become impossible to carry on all the regular tasks necessary for survival. In most cases, we have internalised a table of cause and effect that help us in accomplishing a desired goal based on a known set of inputs. Some of the entries in this table were results of our own experience (eg., don't touch the hot pan - you'll burn yourself), some were rigorously derived by experts (scientific principles or economic theories), most of which are added to this table without us individuals re-testing them leaving a few that we have tested ourselves, and then there are ones that are handed down by generations (bow down to the thunder god - else, no soup for you) or distributed by peers (invest in this stock - it's the bomb).

You, a rationalist, wouldn't let an entry stray into your table of short-circuits without testing it yourself or knowing that it can be tested by a peer. Or would you?

In reality, a slip-up is highly possible. No matter how intelligent we are, there is a limit to the complexity of a system that can be processed in our head. This is mainly because of the non-linear nature of most natural sciences.

## Simplify

It is not advisable to simplify the models that describe various phenomena any more than necessary. Yet, it is interesting to point out that simple models exists for phenomena that can be described by a few, bounded variables. This is the key to personal liberation.

We can easily avoid short-circuiting our decision making process if we simplify our day to day life. While this will not simplify the workings of the world around us, it will definitely help us in avoiding our brain's tendency to short-circuit a decision making process and arrive at an answer that is not the actual solution to the problem.

## So, where can we simplify

Our endless wants, our reliance on things we don't need with the money that we don't have, things that we own, things that we don't own, our reliance on overly complicated ideas, my reliance on complex and compound sentences.
