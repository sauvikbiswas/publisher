If my [introductory post](p-in-zen) read like a cryptic rant, then forgive me, for it was intentional. I, in my full senses, take responsibility of its cryptic nature.

## Acknowledge the existence of short-circuit thinking

We, human beings, are designed to short-circuit a thinking process that is of sufficient complexity. This is purely an evolutionary trait. Without the existence of such short-circuits, it would become impossible to carry on all the regular tasks necessary for survival. In most cases, we have internalised a table of cause and effect that help us in accomplishing a desired goal based on a known set of inputs. Some of the entries in this table were results of our own experience (eg., don't touch the hot pan - you'll burn yourself), some were rigorously derived by experts (scientific principles or economic theories), most of which are added to this table without us individuals re-testing them leaving a few that we have tested ourselves, and then there are ones that are handed down by generations (bow down to the thunder god - else, no soup for you) or distributed by peers (invest in this stock - it's the bomb).

We, rationalists, wouldn't let an entry stray into our table of short-circuits without testing it ourselves or knowing that it can be tested by a peer. Or would we?

In reality, a slip-up is highly possible. No matter how intelligent we are, there is a limit to the complexity of a system that can be processed in our head. This is mainly because of the non-linear nature of most natural sciences.

## Simplify

It is not advisable to simplify the models that describe various phenomena any more than necessary. Yet, it is interesting to point out that simple models exists for phenomena that can be described by a few, bounded variables. This is the key to personal liberation.

We can easily avoid short-circuiting our decision making process if we simplify our day to day life. While this will not simplify the workings of the world around us, it will definitely help us in avoiding our brain's tendency to short-circuit a decision making process and arrive at an answer that is not the actual solution to the problem.

## So, where can we simplify?

Our endless wants, our reliance on things we don't need with the money that we don't have, things that we own, things that we don't own, our reliance on overly complicated ideas, my reliance on complex and compound sentences.

All these are [crutches](https://zenhabits.net/crutch/).

This is my path to liberation. It could as well be yours. Simplification is a corollary to standardisation. To a trainee in a fast food joint, the standardisation is handed down by those who have designed the process. This ensures that the product is consistent. To us, standardisation should be the outcome of a process that we have designed for ourselves.

This has another side-effect. It rids the thought process of any impulsive decision, which in turn is a by-product of short-circuit thinking.

## Don't simplify everything

Just because our day-to-day decisions and processes must be simplified doesn't mean that our thought process should be, too. In fact, our rational minds must be guided to test as many hypotheses as possible, no matter how complex they are. However, once we have realised the true relationships between cause and effect within the bounds of our influence, we should waste no further mental bandwidth and let it slip into auto mode. This will free up our minds for a set of different, complex challenges.

For example, lesser amount of things in possession would mean lesser amount of time and money in their maintenance. Not to mention, this will tremendously help in improving your net worth. This has been well documented by people who are into [minimalism](http://www.theminimalists.com/minimalism/).
